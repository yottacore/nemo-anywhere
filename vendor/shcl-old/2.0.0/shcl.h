// Everything is byte-for-byte with the Rust reference (source/rust); the cicd
// cross-binding check compares CLI stdout + exit codes across every binding.
// The language spec lives in project/spec.md; project/conformance/ pins behavior.
// Structure deliberately mirrors the reference over C-local shortcuts, so a fix
// there ports here by mechanical diff (parity over idiom - see style-guide.md).
//
// A companion C++ typed veneer (get<int64_t>() etc.) sits in shcl.hpp; it wraps
// this core, it is not a second parser.

// The file tier calls POSIX (fdopen, fileno, fchmod, open, fsync, getpid). Those
// prototypes are feature-gated, and a feature request only counts before the
// first system header - so it goes here rather than beside the code needing it,
// and a consumer who already asked for a level keeps theirs.
